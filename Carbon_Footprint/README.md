## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- Data was collected through **Google Forms**, where respondents provided information about energy usage, transportation, diet, and waste habits.
- Responses were exported as **CSV files**.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Excel was used to **remove duplicates, fix missing values**, and **standardize data**.
- Cleaned datasets were saved in `.xlsx` format for analysis.

### 3. Data Storage
- Cleaned datasets were stored in a **MySQL database** for structured querying.
- Tables include `Respondents`, `Energy`, `Transportation`, `Diet`, and `Waste`.

### 4. Data Analysis (Python)
- Python (Jupyter Notebook) was used to:
  - Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
  - Calculate average carbon footprint per category
  - Identify trends and anomalies

### 5. Visualization (Power BI)
- Built **interactive dashboards** to analyze:
  - Carbon footprint by category
  - High vs low footprint groups
  - Trends across respondents

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Identified **highest contributors** to carbon footprint.
- Compared carbon footprint based on **transportation, diet, and energy usage**.
- Highlighted areas where individuals can **reduce their environmental impact**.
- Created **interactive visual dashboards** for easy interpretation.
